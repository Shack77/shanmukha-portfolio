        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
  Hello! I'm Shanmukha Ganesna, a passionate software developer currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at Santa Clara University. I have a strong academic background and hands-on experience in full-stack web development, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. I enjoy building scalable applications that solve real-world problems and improve user experience.
</p>

<p>
  My technical journey began with a B.E. in Computer Science from Visvesvaraya Technological University Education, where I developed a solid foundation in programming and system design. Since then, Iâ€™ve worked on several projects involving serverless architecture, machine learning models, and responsive web design. I'm particularly interested in combining AI with modern web technologies to build intelligent, user-centered applications.
</p>

<p>
  Beyond coding, I value continuous learning and enjoy collaborating with others to bring creative ideas to life. Whether it's exploring a new tech stack, optimizing backend performance, or crafting clean UI/UX experiences, I'm driven by the challenge of building things that matter. I'm always open to new opportunities where I can grow, contribute, and make an impact.
</p>
